# Creative Programming and Computing
A repository to collect coding material for the Polimi's course "Creative Programming and Computing" held by prof. Massimiliano Zanoni in A.Y. 2019/2020

# Your first git commands
To _clone_ the repository, i.e., have a synced copy in your local computer, use the URL https://github.com/mbuccoli/creativepc2019.git from your Git client. If you feel bold, you can use the git command line

```
git clone https://github.com/mbuccoli/creativepc2019.git
```
The repository is set as public (everybody can clone it), but only professor and assistants can modify it. If you want to create a new repository starting from this, you can _fork_ the repository on your own Github, by clicking the fork button in the top right corner of the github page.
